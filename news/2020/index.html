          <h2>2020-12-13 ♦ SPACE(TIME) THRESHOLDS Virtual Opening</h2>
          <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/palomakop.tv/news/2020/2020-12-13/spacetime_thresholds.jpg" alt="SPACE(TIME) THRESHOLDS screenshot" loading="lazy"/>
          <p>
            My online MFA thesis exhibition, <i><b>SPACE(TIME) THRESHOLDS</b></i>, virtually opened on Sunday, December 13. This body of work was created during my studies in Electronic Integrated Arts at Alfred University from 2018-2020.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also released the accompanying book, <b><i>From Material Space(time) into Electronic Space(time)</i></b>, which serves as my written thesis and a window into my process. Printed books are available to order, and the digital PDF is linked as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            I performed a livestreamed a/v set to celebrate and bring in a realtime component. It incorporated video and sound elements from the exhibition, manipulated and remixed live.

          <p>
            I performed an a/v set with an 8 foot weather balloon for the opening of <i>Edge of Light</i>, an exhibition curated by Jonathan Sims for HoloCenter. The opening performances were curated by Testu Collective. The opening took place on December 3 and our performances were streamed online.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was my first time incorporating this large spherical balloon into a live performance with analog video synthesis. I found that I was able to create a variety of weather patterns, as one might see on the surface of a gas giant planet.

            On Sunday, November 15, I performed a collaborative a/v set with <a href="https://andreijaycreativecoding.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrei Jay</a>, which was livestreamed as part of <i>Vidicon</i>. This year was the second edition of Vidicon, and due to the pandemic, it took place entirely online, with performances by many wonderful video artists and friends. The set I played with Andrei was enjoyably eccentric. My favorite part was performing on musical saw while video of me was being processed through a slit scan frame buffer. We had a lot of fun! Additionally, the <a href="https://scanlines.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scanlines.xyz</a> team and I were able to contribute to the festival's video streaming and chat infrastructure, to help create an online venue independent from major social media sites and platforms.

          <p>
            There's a lot going on in the world right now, but I wanted to share a small update from my end. As you might know, I'm currently in my final semester of my MFA program at Alfred, located in a remote town in western NY. My university recently announced that all classes will be remote for the rest of the semester. The art building was shut down and I lost access to my studio, so I moved all my equipment to my apartment, and set up a temporary workspace in which to complete my thesis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our in-person thesis exhibitions were cancelled. I have decided to move to an online exhibition format — basically a site to allow viewing of my thesis work online. Although I haven't pursued web-based media as much recently, this is something I luckily have experience with, from working with The Wrong, Gallery T, and others. And in spite of the gravity of the situation, I am excited to be able to present my thesis work in a format that will be even more accessible to people regardless of their geographic location.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the show, our thesis work will also culminate in the form of a book. I am going ahead with creating and printing my books as I had originally planned. I will be sharing my book freely and openly in digital PDF form, but I also want to offer printed copies for those who want them. I'll be opening up pre-orders for the book in advance of their printing in May/June.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am trying to decrease my dependency on certain social media platforms, so as an alternative way to keep people in the loop about my activities, I've created a <a href="/newsletter">newsletter/mailing list</a>. In addition to updates about my upcoming online thesis show and book, I'll send occasional updates when I am doing a show or performance.

            My work is included in <i>Metacognition</i>, an exhibit at Spring/Break Art Show, curated by Tali Hinkis and Robin Kang. It ran from March 3-9 in NYC.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Metacognition: the awareness and understanding of one's own thought processes. This exhibition surrounds a conversation between a group of artists who employ meditative and repetitive processes to creatively navigate through the dimensional realms of reality. The physical, algorithmic, emotional, virtual, spiritual, and scientific planes are investigated through clever uses of technology and innovative combinations of the material and the digital.</i>

          <p>
            I created a short book to explain some of my process and ideas about <a href="/works/decoherence">a video piece I made using cymatics</a>. The book is a small part of my MFA thesis, and I printed and bound several to share with faculty.
