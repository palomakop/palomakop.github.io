          <h2>2023-10-31 ♦ SYNTHETIC FOREST at Coaxial</h2>
          <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/palomakop.tv/news/2023/2023-10-31/synthetic_forest_1440px.jpg" alt="Synthetic Forest performance/installation at Coaxial" loading="lazy"/>
          <p>
            During the last week of October, <a href="https://andreijaycreativecoding.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrei</a> and I did an artist residency at <a href="https://coaxialarts.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coaxial Arts</a> in Los Angeles as <a href="https://phaseshift.zone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phase Shift Collective</a>. During our our time there, we created an installation/environment which also served as our stage and setup for a live performance, titled <i>Synthetic Forest</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The concept was inspired by the time we spent camping in national forests during our five-month road trip across the US. Throughout our travels, we made video and sound recordings in nature, which we sampled and remixed in the performance. We wanted to create an environment which combined materials from the natural landscape with the synthetic elements of our electronic sound and video processing techniques. In our installation, we used real and synthetic plants and moss, chalk on the floor, overhead projectors, CRT screens, and a fog machine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Andrei performed live video using a combination of liquid light show techniques, camera feedback, footage from our walks in the forest, and <a href="https://andreijaycreativecoding.com/GRAVITY_WAAAVES" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gravity_waaaves</a>, a video processor/frame buffer device they created.
          </p>
          <p>
            I performed quadraphonic sound with field recording samples, a foley box containing dried leaves, bells, a kalimba and an AM radio, synths, and granular and spatial processing. It was my first time performing music in quad, so it was exciting to create an immersive sonic landscape with Coaxial's multichannel speaker setup.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've known about Coaxial for a long time, and it was really cool to finally get to be there in person. Many thanks to KA, Chloe, Eva, and Brock for their help and hospitality. We look forward to visiting again in the future!
          </p>

          <h2>2023-10-23 ♦ Artist Talk at CalArts</h2>
          <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/palomakop.tv/news/2023/2023-10-23/calarts_1440px.jpg" alt="Artist Talk at CalArts" loading="lazy"/>
          <p>
            On October 23, we did a <a href="https://phaseshift.zone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phase Shift</a> artist talk/workshop at <a href="https://calarts.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California Institute for the Arts</a> in Santa Clarita, CA. We visited a class called Creative Technology Forum with professor Josephine Shetty. <a href="https://andreijaycreativecoding.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrei</a> and I took turns showing some of our individual artwork and collaborations, and then the students tried out some of our video feedback setups in an interactive demo at the end.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was excited to see that the students in this class were very engaged with their own unique projects and art practices. They asked insightful questions which showed that what we were doing was relevant to their own work. I was impressed with the level of initiative and self-direction of the students, and the level of creative cross-pollination that seemed to be taking place within the class.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many thanks to Josephine for having us in her class and to Michael Bailey, audiovisual artist and CalArts student, for inviting us!
          </p>

          <h2>2023-10-19 ♦ Workshop/Talk at Indexical</h2>
          <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/palomakop.tv/news/2023/2023-10-19/indexical_workshop_1440px.jpg" alt="Workshop at Indexical in Santa Cruz" loading="lazy"/>
          <p>
            On October 19, we led a <a href="https://phaseshift.zone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phase Shift</a> workshop and artist talk at <a href="https://www.indexical.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indexical</a> in Santa Cruz, with special guests <a href="http://www.allen-riley.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allen Riley</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/0VdLVwDwm7s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Denise Gallant</a>. It was wonderful to see Allen, who is a good friend and former Brooklyn neighbor, now working on his PhD at UC Santa Cruz. It was also my first time meeting Denise, who has been working with video synthesis since the 1970s!
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="http://www.michaelmasaruflora.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Masaru Flora</a>, my former classmate at Alfred and fellow audiovisual artist, helped us set up the event. He's now the Executive Director at Indexical! I'd heard lots of good things about this venue, so it was cool to finally get to be there in person.
          </p>
          <p>
            We had a great turnout. Most of the folks who came were somehow associated with UC Santa Cruz. We had a record number of video game developers. The event was a combination of an artist talk and a workshop, beginning with each of us sharing about our art practice and demonstrating some techniques, and ending with an interactive opportunity to explore our tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Much gratitude to Allen, Denise, and Michael. We look forward to visiting Santa Cruz again!

          <p>
            On October 12, we hosted a <a href="https://phaseshift.zone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phase Shift</a> Video Artist Meetup at <a href="https://www.syzygysf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syzygy</a> in San Francisco, in collaboration with <a href="https://avclubsf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AV Club</a>, a local art collective for technology-based performers. We set up an interactive demo of some of our gear, including <a href="https://andreijaycreativecoding.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrei's</a> gravity_waaaves, waaave_pool and artificial_life. Our friend <a href="https://www.seanrussellhallowell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sean Russell Hallowell</a> also brought his self-built modular video synthesizer (and we had some fun sending signals back and forth between our systems). 
          </p>
          <p>
            Syzygy is a really nice community-run space, and the AV Club there is an awesome hub of algorave folks in the area. I had a great time meeting a bunch of new people, including <a href="http://art.sarahghp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah GHP</a>, a fellow video artist who I'd only known from online.

            On October 5, we did a visiting artist workshop at University of Oregon in Eugene, for the class Digital Imaging taught by our friend <a href="https://www.kevinkripper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kevin Kripper</a>. We discussed iterative processes, feedback loops & recursion, and reaction-diffusion/Turing patterns in digital & analog processes and in nature. The students learned how to generate their own Turing patterns from photos, like in the examples below.

          <p>
            While camping in the national forests in Wyoming and Montana, I spent some time looking closely at the many forms of moss, lichen, fungi, and flora inhabiting the forest floor. Since much of my artwork draws inspiration from the intersection between the organic and the algorithmic, I decided to take a macro lens and try to document some of this wealth of fascinating tiny landscapes and patterns, for later reference and admiration. Here are some of my favorites.

          <h2>2023-07-20 ♦ Workshop in Minneapolis</h2>
          <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/palomakop.tv/news/2023/2023-07-20/minneapolis_workshop.jpg" alt="Demonstrating video feedback techniques at Minneapolis workshop" loading="lazy"/>
          <p>
            On July 20, we led a <a href="https://phaseshift.zone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phase Shift</a> video art workshop at a public library in Minneapolis. With the help of our local artist friends, we were able to set up six stations for exploration of video feedback with cameras, processors, and mixers. Since Minneapolis has a thriving a/v art scene, there was a lot of interest, and many people came to participate. I also had an amazing time jamming with a bunch of people the following weekend.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the past few years, I've been living in Brooklyn, working a full-time tech job, and helping run a video art studio and collective called Phase Space out of my basement. Now, I've left the city and started a six-month road trip across the USA and back with my partner & collaborator, Andrei. Since we have left Brooklyn for the foreseeable future, Phase Space has come to a close after four excellent years of offering workshops, events, and community. However, some of my friends and I are working on some new projects which will continue the spirit of Phase in two ways...
          </p>
          <p>
            First of these is <b>Phase Shift Collective</b>, which consists of Andrei and myself teaching workshops, attending artist residencies, and visiting art spaces across the country as we travel. You can find out more on our new website for this (also lovingly hand-coded with plain html/css):
          </p>
          <p>
            🌐 <a href="https://phaseshift.zone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phaseshift.zone</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, me, Andrei, and our friends Tim Caldwell and Sean Hallowell have started <b>Polyphase Portal</b>, a DIY, collectively-run online school that hosts workshops, classes, and talks. We already have some classes on the schedule, and I hope to lead an online workshop in the next few months on making simple, hand-coded websites in HTML and CSS that bring back some of the magic of the early internet. Polyphase is online at:
          </p>
          <p>
            🌐 <a href="https://polyphaseportal.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polyphaseportal.xyz</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            We've only just started our road trip, and we are deliberately moving quite slowly, but we'll be on the west coast by September, and then driving back and spending most of the winter in upstate New York. Our first major stop will be at a 1-week residency later this month at <a href="https://feed.art" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FEED</a>, a new art center in Erie, Pennsylvania, founded by Benton C Bainbridge.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am hoping that these life changes will will lead to more time and energy spent on creative and independent projects, and I'm looking forward to spending more time in nature and meeting like-minded people in different parts of the country. I find my lifestyle is becoming more and more offline and low-tech, but I also want to stay connected and share what I'm up to, so <a href="/newsletter">stay tuned</a> for more updates over the next few months!

          <h2>2023-05-06 ♦ OUT OF PHASE at Phase Space</h2>

          <p>
            On Saturday, May 6, we hosted our last show at <a href="https://phasespace.nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phase Space</a> before moving out (more on that soon). I performed live ambient music for a collaborative a/v set with <a href="https://andreijaycreativecoding.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrei Jay</a> as REALITY ORP. Our friend <a href="https://groceries-store.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">식료품groceries</a> did a set as well! As always, there were a variety of installations on view throughout the event, and we also had tarot readings.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will miss organizing events here in Brooklyn, but our friends are taking over the space and continuing to do cool stuff there, while Andrei and I are hitting the road for a cross country tour. So this was also a bit of a going away party, and a final hurrah for Phase Space as we know it.
          </p>
