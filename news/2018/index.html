            On Saturday, October 20, I did a solo experimental a/v performance at <i><a href="http://www.transientvisions.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transient Visions: Festival of the Moving Image</a></i>, held at Spool Mfg. in Johnson City, NY. My performance closed out the festival following an evening of experimental film screenings.

            <i>Post Analog</i>, an exhibition of new print and video works by me and fellow media artist Sara Goodman, opened on September 20th in Portland, OR! The show was curated by Sarah Turner, and will be up at Grapefruits Art Space until October 21. During the opening celebration, there was a live transmission-based sound performance by <i>drc // erc</i>, a collaborative duo of local experimental musicians Darcy Neal and Erin Cooper.

            I performed an experimental A/V set as <i>sleepwalks</i>, as well as providing visuals for the rest of the acts, at this show at Trans-Pecos in Brooklyn. It was fun to collaborate with some touring artists from Minneapolis, and the collaborative set by Machine Girl and Bonnie Baxter (of Kill Alters) had people dancing so hard I felt as though the floor might collapse. For me, this show was a way to say goodbye to Brooklyn, as I prepared to move upstate for grad school.

            On July 27th, I performed an experimental audio-visual set as sleepwalks at Secret Project Robot in Brooklyn. The show was organized by <a href="https://euglossine.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">euglossine</a>, an experimental musician from Gainesville, Florida. I enjoyed setting up a cave-like spatialized projection environment and filling it with warm synth sounds and evolving video textures.

          <h2>2018-05-04 ♦ VISIBILITY Exhibition in Buenos Aires</h2>
          <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/palomakop.tv/news/2018/2018-05-04/visibility.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"/>
          <p>
            My work is included in this exhibition at the Kirchner Cultural Centre in Buenos Aires, Argentina, which opened on May 4. The show features six female experimental audiovisual artists from different countries, including Blanca Rego (Spain), Modular Dreams (Brazil), Sol del Río (Argentina), AGF poemproducer (Germany), Sabrina Ratté (Canada), VJ Um Amel (Egypt), and myself (United States). It was curated by Milena Pafundi.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is a rough translation of the description (originally in Spanish): <i>Visibility is a disruptive sample because it brings together the power of women's work in the field of audiovisual experimentation. It is about artists that are also the representation of many others that are out there producing and simply can not be seen, because we still have to deconstruct prejudices around minority women / trans / non-binary in relation to technology, art, and their presence in formal spaces: the works of women usually take place only on the internet.</i>

            On Saturday, April 21, I performed video for a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1763772500347301/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concert</a> at a church in Brooklyn, NY featuring ambient electronic music sets by Malcolm Cecil (formerly of TONTO's Expanding Head Band) and Steve Moore (of Zombi). I output two channels of live analog video, which corresponded to layers of projection mapping in the architectural environment. I loved helping to create such an immersive and transportive audiovisual experience, and I hope to incorporate projection mapping in future performances. Many thanks to <a href="http://ambient.church/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ambient Church</a> for inviting me.

          <p>
            On Saturday, April 7, I organized the second edition of <i>Télépresence</i>, a yearly conference of analog video artists and evening of audio visual performance. I also performed as 1/2 of <i>Fugitive Dream Recovery</i>, a collaborative side project. We held a tabling session for artists to show the methods and devices they use to manipulate video signals, then hosted an evening of a/v performances. 
          </p>
          <p>
            It was amazing to hang with artists and engineers from all across the U.S. and Canada, and very rewarding to get the chance to help facilitate creative cross-pollination around the medium of video. Many thanks to everyone who helped make it happen.

A number of guests were also able to make their way through the snow to watch. The result was a very special and intimate atmosphere.
