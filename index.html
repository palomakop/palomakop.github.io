        Hello, visitor!
      </h2>

      <p>
        My name is Paloma Kop, and I'm a multimedia artist from New York.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm currently in the process of building a new website, so this space is under construction. Please be patient :)
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm building this site manually with plain html and css. My goal is to present my artwork, some info about myself, and some recent updates, in as simple and accessible format as I can. I will definitely be learning along the way. Thanks for visiting!
